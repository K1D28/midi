## Principles

### Code Quality
- Ensure all code is clean, readable, and adheres to established style guides.
- Prioritize maintainability and modularity in all implementations.
- Leverage vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to minimize dependencies and simplify the codebase.

### Testing Standards
- Write comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all features.
- Maintain a minimum of 90% test coverage across the codebase.

### User Experience Consistency
- Design interfaces that are intuitive and accessible to all users.
- Maintain consistent design patterns and interactions throughout the application.

### Performance Requirements
- Optimize code for efficiency and scalability, ensuring smooth operation with minimal libraries.
- Regularly monitor and address performance bottlenecks.
- Store metadata locally in an SQLite database to enhance performance and reduce external dependencies.

### Development Plan
- Utilize Vite as the build tool to ensure fast development and optimized builds.
- Minimize the use of external libraries, relying primarily on vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Avoid uploading images or external assets; handle all resources locally.
- Store and manage metadata in a local SQLite database to maintain performance and reduce external dependencies.

### Tasks
- Define the core architecture and structure of the application.
- Implement the SQLite database schema for metadata storage.
- Develop a sequencer interface with intuitive controls for users.
- Create unit tests for all core functionalities.
- Optimize the application for performance and scalability.
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.
- Document all features and APIs for developer reference.

- Conduct regular code reviews to ensure adherence to quality standards.
- Establish a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.
- Create detailed user guides and tutorials to assist users in understanding the application.
- Perform usability testing to gather feedback and improve the user experience.
- Monitor application performance post-deployment and address any issues promptly.
